## Features

We implemented a Bottom Navigation bar that allows users to switch from activity to activity. 
Using a web service, we have a list of various workout activities that are stored on a database through
Heroku. Also included in this sprint is a Profile tab where users can view and edit their personal 
statistics, such as weight and height, as they progress on their fitness journey.

## User Stories

1. A user wants to view a list of workouts and details pertaining to the level of difficulty 
and the targeted areas each activity focuses on.

2. A user wants to send and receive alerts to other users through the app.

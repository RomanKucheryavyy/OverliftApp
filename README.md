# Overlift - Team 2

Created by Ilya Bokov, Mercedes Chea, Ross Martsenyak, Roman Kucheryavyy

## Features

We implemented a Bottom Navigation bar that allows users to switch from activity to activity. 
Using a web service, we have a list of various workout activities that are stored on a database through
Heroku. Workouts are listed in an activity and can be tapped for more information. Also included in this sprint is a Profile tab where users can view and edit their personal 
statistics, such as weight and height, as they progress on their fitness journey.

## User Stories

1. A user wants to view a list of workouts and details pertaining to the level of difficulty 
and the targeted areas each activity focuses on.

2. A user wants to send and receive alerts to other users through the app.

## Notes/Bugs
We noticed that restarting Android Studio upon opening the app helps build the gradle files with the Java files.
Social activity aspect works on Ilya's and Mercedes' computer, however does not work on Roman's.

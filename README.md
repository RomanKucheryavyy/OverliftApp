# Overlift - Team 2

Created by Roman Kucheryavyy Ilya Bokov, Mercedes Chea, Ross Martsenyak

## Features

Overlift opens with a sign-in/register page in which users use their email address and a password. They are then provided with a list of other users who have previously registered and can contact and send notifications to through Overlift. Additionally, we implemented a Bottom Navigation bar that allows users to switch from activity to activity. Using a web service, we have a list of various workout activities that are stored on a database through Heroku. Workouts are listed in an activity and can be tapped for more information. Also included in this sprint is a Profile tab where users can view and edit their personal statistics, such as weight and height, as they progress on their fitness journey.

## User Stories

1. A user wants to view a list of workouts and details pertaining to the level of difficulty 
and the targeted areas of the body each activity focuses on.

2. A user wants to send and receive alerts to other users through the app.

## Notes/Bugs
We noticed that restarting Android Studio upon opening the app helps build the gradle files with the Java files.
When registering for an account, we noticed that it works on Ilya's and Mercedes' computer, however does not work on Roman's. Once a message is sent, the back button will run the app in the background.
